# Bamazon


Bamazon is a storefront built with MySQL and Node.js like Amazon. 

In the customer portal, you can view the inventory, choose an item you'd like to purchase
along with the quantity. You will get a "Transaction complete!" message at the end of shopping. 
However, if we do not have enough of the selected item in stock we will be unable to fulfill your 
purchase therefore, the transaction will not go through.
